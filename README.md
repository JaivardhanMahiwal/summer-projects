# Collection of Summer Projects

## Projects Overview

### 1. Percolation Simulation

#### Description:
Implemented a percolation simulation in Python to model fluid flow through a porous medium. Utilized Monte Carlo simulations to determine percolation thresholds in various grid configurations.

#### Key Features:
- Monte Carlo simulation methodology.
- Visualization of percolation thresholds and clusters using matplotlib.

#### Technologies Used:
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib

### 2. Seam Carving Algorithm

#### Description:
Developed a content-aware image resizing algorithm in C++. Modified Dijkstra's algorithm and employed an index-based priority queue to efficiently find the minimum energy path in images, preserving important content.

#### Key Features:
- Custom energy functions (gradient magnitude, Sobel filter).
- Dynamic programming approach for image resizing.

#### Technologies Used:
C++, OpenCV, Data Structures (index-based priority queue)

### 3. Cash Flow Minimizer

#### Description:
Created a financial optimization tool in Python to minimize cash flow transactions among individuals or entities. Implemented the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm to consolidate transactions efficiently.

#### Key Features:
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm implementation.
- Simplification of cash flow networks to minimize transactions.

#### Technologies Used:
Python, NetworkX (for graph algorithms)

### 4. Extraction of Stock Sentiment

#### Description:
Developed a sentiment analysis tool in Python to extract sentiment from stock-related news articles and tweets. Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment and predict market trends.

#### Key Features:
- Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques (e.g., Vader sentiment analysis).
- Integration with APIs to fetch real-time news and social media data.

#### Technologies Used:
Python, NLTK, Vader Sentiment Analyzer, API integration
